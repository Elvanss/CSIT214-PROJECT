# CSIT214-FlyDreamAir-Project
FlyDreamAir, an international airline, is launching a new frequent flyer program. The program aims to enable customers to accumulate points by flying with the airline, which can later be redeemed through an online storefront.

The objective of this application is as follows:
  - Develop and implement a program to efficiently track and manage user frequent flyer points.
  - Create a user-friendly website featuring a secure login and accounts system.
  - Provide users with the ability to redeem a diverse range of rewards using their accumulated frequent flyer points.
 
To accomplish this, the system is built upon Node.js, a robust server environment, and utilizes Express.js, a powerful Node.js framework specifically designed for managing servers and routes. Detailed documentation for Node.js and Express.js can be accessed at the following links: [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) and [Express.js API Reference](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html).

By employing these technologies, FlyDreamAir aims to deliver a seamless and efficient experience for its valued customers, enhancing their engagement with the airline while offering exciting rewards for their loyalty.
