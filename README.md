The objective of this application is as follows:
  - Develop and implement a program to efficiently track and manage user frequent flyer points.
  - Create a user-friendly website featuring a secure login and accounts system.
  - Provide users with the ability to redeem a diverse range of rewards using their accumulated frequent flyer points.
 
To accomplish this, the system is built upon Node.js, a robust server environment, and utilizes Express.js, a powerful Node.js framework specifically designed for managing servers and routes. Detailed documentation for Node.js and Express.js can be accessed at the following links: [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) and [Express.js API Reference](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html).

By employing these technologies, FlyDreamAir aims to deliver a seamless and efficient experience for its valued customers, enhancing their engagement with the airline while offering exciting rewards for their loyalty.
