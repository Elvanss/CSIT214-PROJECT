# CSIT214-FlyDreamAir-Project
FlyDreamAir is an international airline, launching a new frequent flyer program. The program allows customers to accumulate points through making flights with the airline, which can then be spent with an online storefront. 

This application will:
  - Design and produce a program to track user frequent flyer points.
  - The website will have a login & accounts system.
  - Allow the user to redeem a variety of rewards from their frequent flyer points.
 
The system is implemented using Node.js. The documentation for Node.js can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/

How to launch web client:
1. Download NodeJs from https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Run the command prompt in the web folder directory, and use the command "node server.js" in the web directory.
3. Open your browser of choice, and enter "http://localhost:8000/" into the URL bar.
4. Sign up or login to begin (All usernames and passwords are currently stored locally, and will therefore only work on your local drive).
